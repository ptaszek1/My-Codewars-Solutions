<h1>Find the next perfect square!</h1>

<p>You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
   
   Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
   
   If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>

<ul>
<li>findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144</li>
<li>findNextSquare(625) --> returns 676</li>
<li>findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect</li>
</ul>
