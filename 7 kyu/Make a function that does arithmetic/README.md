<h1>Make a function that does arithmetic!</h1>

<p>Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.
   
   a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.
   
   The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply". </p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>

<ul>
<li>arithmetic(5, 2, "add")      => returns 7</li>
<li>arithmetic(5, 2, "subtract") => returns 3</li>
<li>arithmetic(5, 2, "multiply") => returns 10</li>
<li>arithmetic(5, 2, "divide")   => returns 2.5</li>
</ul>
