<h1>header</h1>

<p>This challenge extends the previous repeater() challenge. Just like last time, your job is to write a function that accepts a string and a number as arguments. This time, however, you should format the string you return like this:</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>

<ul>
<li>repeater('yo', 3)  -  '"yo" repeated 3 times is: "yoyoyo"'</li>
<li>>>> repeater('WuB', 6)  -  '"WuB" repeated 6 times is: "WuBWuBWuBWuBWuBWuB"'</li>
</ul>
