# :star:header

This challenge extends the previous repeater() challenge. Just like last time, your job is to write a function that accepts a string and a number as arguments. This time, however, you should format the string you return like this:
# :star:Examples:


> repeater('yo', 3)  -  '"yo" repeated 3 times is: "yoyoyo"'<br>
> repeater('WuB', 6)  -  '"WuB" repeated 6 times is: "WuBWuBWuBWuBWuBWuB"'
