<h1>Convert Integer to Binary</h1>

<p>Convert integers to binary as simple as that. You would be given an integer as a argument and you have to return its binary form. To get an idea about how to convert a decimal number into a binary number, visit here.
   
   Notes: negative numbers should be handled as two's complement; assume all numbers are integers stored using 4 bytes (or 32 bits) in any language.
   
   Your output should ignore leading 0s.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>

<ul>
<li>toBinary(3)=="11"</li>
