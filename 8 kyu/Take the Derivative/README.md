# :star:Take the Derivative

This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent. Your coefficient should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7).

>   derive(7,8) // this should output "56x^7" <br>
    derive(5,9) // this should output "45x^8"
