<h1>Sentence Smash</h1>

<p>Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>

<p>var words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'];<br>
   smash(words); // returns "hello world this is great"</p>
