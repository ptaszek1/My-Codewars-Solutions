<h1>Do I get a bonus?</h1>

<p>Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
   
   If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.</p>
