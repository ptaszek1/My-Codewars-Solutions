# :star:Sum without highest and lowest number

Sum all the numbers of the array (in F# and Haskell you get a list) except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
(The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)

# :star:Examples:

    { 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
    { 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
