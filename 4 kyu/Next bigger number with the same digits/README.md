# :star:Next bigger number with the same digits

You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

# :star:Examples:

> nextBigger(12)==21<br>
> nextBigger(513)==531<br>
> nextBigger(2017)==2071

If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

> nextBigger(9)==-1<br>
> nextBigger(111)==-1<br>
> nextBigger(531)==-1
